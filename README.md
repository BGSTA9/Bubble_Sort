Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. Despite its simplicity, it is 
not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high. 
The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them 
if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Characteristics

	•	Type: Comparison Sort
	•	Stable: Yes
	•	Time Complexity: O(n²) in the average and worst case, O(n) in the best case when the array is already sorted
	•	Space Complexity: O(1), as it sorts the array in place
	•	Best for: Small datasets or nearly sorted datasets

How It Works

	1.	Initialization: Start at the beginning of the array.
	2.	Comparison: Compare the current element with the next element.
	3.	Swap: If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
	4.	Repeat: Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap steps.
	5.	Iteration: Repeat the entire process for each element in the array until no swaps are needed in a full pass through the array.
